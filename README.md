## Project Highlights
## 1. Data Gathering and Automation
-	Consolidated sales data from various file formats (Excel, CSV, Database).
-	Developed a resilient mechanism to load yearly sales data dynamically:
-	Automatically integrates new files added to the sales folder.
-	Handles missing files without causing errors.

## 2. Data Modeling and Transformation
### Data Cleaning and Preparation:
-	Split the "Location" field into Country and City columns for accurate geographical mapping.
-	Adjusted date formats to enable time-series analysis.
-	Custom Function:
-	Created a reusable function to clean and format ID columns in SalesRep and SubCategory tables.
### Data Modeling:
-	Connected all tables using relationships and a prebuilt Calendar Table.
-	Added a unique GeoKey to link the Sales and Geography tables.

## 3. DAX Calculations
### 	Implemented key measures for actionable insights:
-	Total Revenue: Productâ€™s Retail Price Ã— Units Sold.
-	Total Cost: Productâ€™s Standard Cost Ã— Units Sold.
-	Gross Profit: Total Revenue - Total Cost.
-	Gross Profit MoM Growth %: Month-over-Month growth rate for profit.
-	Average Sales per Day: Average Total Revenue per sales day.
-	QoQ Growth: Quarter-over-Quarter growth for the Quarterly Business Review (QBR) report.
-	Product-Level Breakdown: Analyzed trends for product performance (drop or increase).

## 4. Visualizations
Designed a one-page interactive dashboard to showcase sales insights:
â€¢	KPI Cards: Display key metrics such as Total Revenue, Gross Profit, and Average Sales per Day.
â€¢	Geo Maps: Highlight sales performance by Country and City.
â€¢	Bar and Line Charts: Track MoM and QoQ growth, and compare sales across categories.
â€¢	Product Analysis Visuals: Identify top-performing and underperforming products.
â€¢	Sorted Month Axis: Ensures months are arranged from January to December for clarity.
